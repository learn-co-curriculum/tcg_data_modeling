# Data Modeling

Representing human problems in software - data modeling - is at the heart of Software Engineering. In the next few lessons, you'll practice modeling data and writing code to translate real-world problems into software.

The requirements and problem descriptions for systems will be vague and underspecified. You'll need to make decisions about the design. Be intentional when you do - you should be able to describe your reasoning and why you picked your design over alternatives.

We're going to work through some of CMU's [Model Problems in Software Engineering](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ModProb/index.html). Before you start working through these problems, read about [the Idea of Model Problems](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ModProb/idea.html) and their [Benefits](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ModProb/benefits.html).

The next few lessons will introduce a tool for reasoning about data models, then let you practice modeling data to solve problems. In each case, your strategy should start with reading the requirements and planning the architecture. Then, you should use Test-Driven Development to write code to implement your design. After you have written (and refactored) your solution, see if you can get a colleague to review your code and give you feedback.
